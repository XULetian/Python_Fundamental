'''
Arugument: input the position of F1 and F2, the length of major axis,
        and the number of random point to estimate the erea.
Return: the number of random points that satisfy the requirement of the equation:
        |PF1| + |PF2| = 2a.
Notes: from 100 to -100 is the random points' range.
        the return value, the number of random points, is a approximate number of the erea of ellipse.
